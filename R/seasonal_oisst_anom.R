#' Sea-surface temperature anomaly time serries
#'
#' Data include seasonal time series of sea-surface temperature anomalies on the Northeast Continental Shelf.
#' These data were derived from the NOAA Optimum Interpolation SST High Resolution data set (NOAA OISST V2). The
#' 1982-2010 climatology was used to calculate anomalies.
#'
#' @format 492 observations in 4 columns
#'
#' \itemize{
#'     \item Value: SST anomaly in degrees C.
#'     \item EPU: Ecological Production Unit that data were collected from.
#'     \item Var: Specifies season of anomaly.
#'     \item Time: Year.
#' }

#' @details Seasons are defined as: Fall = October, November, December; Winter = January, February, March; Spring = April,
#' May, June; Summer = July, August, September. Methods used to derive these data are available at \url{https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata25/blob/master/data-raw/get_seasonal_oisst_anom.R}.
